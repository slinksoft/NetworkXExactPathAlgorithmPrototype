# NetworkXExactPathAlgorithmPrototype
A prototype for an exact path algorithm based on user specified propagation delay. This prototype is for the AmLight SDN Research project that I am a part of.

The code contains Marvin's depth-first search algorithm and my extension to collect all possible paths and analyze them for paths that are close to the user-specified delay if no exact path is found.


Check out Marvin's Github repo (he developed the algorithm):

NOTE: Every prototype added includes different implementations and improvements from its previous versions. The following is the current progression (early to latest):

1. prototype-rangeextension.py
2. prototype.py
3. improvedPrototype.py
4. prototypeImprovedWithDavidsChanges.py
